    text: `“Our group of six (three couples) enjoyed a fantastic 7-day, 6-night trip to Thailand, visiting Pattaya, Bangkok, Krabi, Phuket, and Phi Phi.`,
    fullText: `The trip was wonderfully organized by Ajwa, with exceptional support from Najiha and Ashiq. They were instrumental in making our trip memorable and budget-friendly. When our original hotel booking was cancelled, Ajwa went above and beyond, securing us new accommodations in a prime location on Patong Beach in Phuket – a definite upgrade to our initial plans! The transportation arrangements were also excellent. I highly recommend Ajwa for anyone planning a trip to Thailand.`,
